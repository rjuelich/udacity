Here is your mini project
-- Create your very own secret message for a friend or a loved one.
-- You should feel free to use images of the alphabet that we have provided in the instructor notes
-- Start by showing your friend the jumbled up version of the message; then run the program to reveal your secret message

Running 'python secret_message.py' will copy/rename files from 'message_scrambled' to 'message_out'. The new files reveal the secret message.
